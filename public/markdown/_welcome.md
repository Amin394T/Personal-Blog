This is a simplistic blog website template that displays a list of blogs, allows searching blogs, and displays the content of a selected blog. It is adapted for both computer and smartphone/tablet views.

The default view shows the list of all blogs sorted by date, you can return to it from anywhere by clicking on the website logo located in the navigation bar, while the search bar allows filtering blogs by title and by tags.

The content section displays the current blog's title, tags (the main tag under the title and all of them at the end of the blog), author, and date, followed by the blog's content.

The feed section displays all blogs when no blog is currently selected, and only 6 blogs when a blog is displayed, it is affected by the search feature however, regardless of whether a blog is being displayed or not. The feed contains blog cards that display a blog's thumbnail, main tag, and title, it is always sorted by date.
