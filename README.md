Use the version found in the build branch. Blogs can be added to the /markdown folder as markdown files, to make it appear in the application an entry containing the blog's metadata should be added in the _files_list.json file present in the same folder (copy and modify an existing entry). In the same folder you can also modify the welcome message (_welcome.md), you can delete the mock-up blogs and remove their entries from _files_list.json.

Thumbnail images can be added in the /images folder, it should preferably have a 3:2 aspect ratio or close. In the same folder you can also modify the header logo (_logo.png), tab icon (_head.png), and placeholder image (_placeholder.png), you can delete the mock-up images.

Do not remove any file starting with an underscore, be it in /markdown or /images, and do not modify/remove any file outside these 2 folders, except if you know what you're doing. You can use versions from other branches if you're a developer.
