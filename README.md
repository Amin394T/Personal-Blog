Use the version found in the build branch. Blogs can be added to the /markdown folder as markdown files, to make it appear in the application an entry containing the blog's metadata should be added in the _files_list.json file present in the same folder (copy and modify an existing entry). In the same folder you can also modify the welcome message by editing the _welcome.json file,

Thumbnail images can be added in the /images folder, it should preferably have a 3:2 aspect ratio or close. In the same folder you can also modify the header logo (_logo.png, 2:1 aspect ratio), tab icon (_head.png, 1:1 aspect ratio), and placeholder image (_placeholder.png, 3:2 aspect ratio).

You can delete the mock-up blogs and their images, and remove their entries from _files_list.json. Do not remove any file starting with an underscore, be it in /markdown or /images, and do not modify/remove any file outside these 2 folders, except if you know what you're doing.
